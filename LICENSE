J3's Custom License. Version 1.0 (22nd of May, 2015)

Since, like most people, I'm too lazy to read full licenses and learn what all of they do. This is my own license.

DO:

Use in modpacks (Please tell me, but no permission is needed)

Learn from the source code (You CAN copy, but credit where necessary)

PLAY WITH IT (Does that even need to be stated?)

DON'T:

Make money off of it (Distributing for money.)

Claim this (and other) work as your own whilst it is not. 

This document is subject to change.
